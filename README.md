# Pulsed Power Control System UAH RCEU 2020
This repository showcases my UAH RCEU project where I programmed a system to control the firing of a pulsed power system. The system utilized and Arduino flashed with Firmata firmware. This then interfaces with the python code I wrote over usb. The code is run on a raspberry pi which is remoted into over a fiber optic ethernet connection. This galvanically isolates the opperator from the high voltage part of the system and the use of the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino minimize the cost of the system. These factors are critical as it is possible for the pulsed power device to backfire into the electronics. With this system if that happens the opperator will remain safe and the cost to replace the whole system is only ~$100. The results of the project were presented to the university with the poster shown below.
